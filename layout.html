                    The annual European Backpacker Index, compiled by priceoftravel.com, is designed to help money-savy travellers find the cheapest European cities
                    and plan an accurate budget for when they visit. <br><br>
                    Prices for most things like hostels, transportation and attractions are fixed and certain. However, prices for a 'budget lunch' or a pint of beer can
                    vary depending on where you go. The index takes all of these factors into account to calculate the approximate price of a day in each city, including
                    an overnight stay at a backpacker hostel. <br><br>
                    Here we review the top five cheapest European cities, as featured on the 2018 Index. Review the complete list of 59 cities at
                    https://www.priceoftravel.com/1979/european- backpacker-index/.
